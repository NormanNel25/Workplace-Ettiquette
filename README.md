# Workplace-Ettiquette
## Dress code, Rules etc
Starting out as a new Service Desk Analyst, I quickly learned that understanding workplace etiquette is just as important as knowing how to fix technical issues. 
One thing that really helped me was learning how to respond to situations in a calm and thoughtful way. When a user reports a problem or feels frustrated, it's easy to feel the pressure but instead of rushing, I take a moment to understand what’s going on, figure out what they need from me, and explain clearly what I’m doing to help.
This way of approaching things helps me stay professional and respectful, even when things get a little stressful.
It’s also helped me build better relationships with both users and team members because I show that I’m listening, that I care, and that I’m taking action. 
Over time, this approach has made it easier for me to stay grounded, communicate better, and handle unexpected situations in a way that reflects the kind of workplace culture we all want to be part of.
